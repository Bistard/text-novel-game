Title: Starry Awakening (A1)
Branch: A1
Description: You wake up, a light cool breeze flowing through your hair, grass flowing in the wind, the quiet of night. Your nap in the field was refreshing. You gaze at the stars, wondering "What is out there? Will I ever see beyond this starry expanse?" You say that as you see a stream of celestial aquatic creatures swim across the night sky. You make out that they are a myriad of various common fish, cephalopods, even sharks just from a glance. Your interest peaks yet your sadness valleys. The thought of such beautiful creatures slowly dying out crosses your mind like a flash flood.

Confused, you still go with your goal to end this crisis but with the lingering thought that the vision is connected.

The place was frozen between hidden memories, mysteries, and nature. Passing through a bundle of vines reveals an entrance inside.

Branch: B18
Description: For the first time, the statue lady parted her lips and spoke with weight. “Humans destroyed this world. They polluted the land and hoarded its wealth. They took the gift of surplus agriculture and used it to create a hierarchy among themselves. It left me, Gaia, in a weakened state unable to help the lives that they forsook. It resulted in bountiful excess for them, but it wasn’t enough. They continued to fight each other for more, leaving the environment and others to die. Eventually, when there was nothing left for them to take, they left this planet. With them gone, the enduring pieces of life were able to regrow, and I was once again able to be a steward for this land. However, I still cannot fix all the problems they created.”

Title: Two Crises (B19)
Branch: B19

The other is a mountain of debris that is damming the river, causing the tainted water to stagnate and rot the land.

After what simultaneously feels like an eternity and a blink, you find yourself in what appears to be trashheap of a world. A mix of various types of ruined buildings, machines, and vegetation cover the land and are scattered in the air. Far in the distance, you can spot a massive towering mass, when you do, a nostalgic flash and a whisper in your mind echoes, “here”.

Title: Faint Glimmer (D4)
Branch: D4
Description: Passing over a crater in fields of trash, you think you spot a light shining in it. When you look again, you can’t seem to spot it.

Title: Crater Search (D5)
Branch: D5
Description: Hovering over the crater you try to pinpoint what you saw while flying. However it is difficult to make out specifics amongst the trash. What you do spot though is the trash shuffling as if there is something swimming underneath. The movement seems to be limited to only one side of the crater, but it may come over if it detects something. You determine that you won’t have enough time to safely get to the shining object you saw while flying unless you either distract whatever is underneath or know exactly where it is.

Title: Perfect Distraction (D6)
Branch: D6
Description: After launching over pieces of the Large bait from your ship, you watch them sink into the ground as the shuffling trash moves towards each piece of bait. After a moment of silence, you see the underground movement calmly travel outside of the crater. With it gone, you can look through trash with peace of mind. A Great Success.

Title: Good Distraction (D7)
Branch: D7
Description: Launching pieces of trash outside of the crater, you watch as the shuffling movement underground speeds out of the crater in the direction you sent the pieces you launched. Now you have time to look through the trash, though the uncertainty of when whatever was underneath will come back is unnerving.
Choice: display=[Search through the trash]; next=D10

Title: Trash Pitfall (D8)
Branch: D8
Description: You try to launch pieces of the garbage around you to distract the shuffling trash. However, it seems that one of your shots landed a bit too close to you and your ship. The ground underneath you shakes and you start to sink into the trash. It seems that you will be joining other pieces of the galaxy in this graveyard.

Title: Hidden Door Found (D9)
Branch: D9
Description: Using the ship’s flood lights you’re able to get a much better look of the trash scattered around. As you scan through the rubble with ease, the light catches upon a reflective surface. You’ve found what you’re looking for. A slow blinking light shines above a slightly ajar metallic door. What you saw must have been the light’s reflection off the door. Taking a peek behind the door, you see a small office room with a computer inside. You determine that an old ship of some kind must have been buried underneath the trash.

Title: Old Ship Cabin (D12)
Branch: D12
Description: With dust blanketing every surface you can tell that it has been ages since someone last passed through. The only movement in the room are your own steps and the blinking lights of a sleeping computer.

Choice: display=[Read the logs]; next=D13
 
Title: Log: Sustenance (D13)
Branch: D13
Description: “We have finally caught up to the great Leviathan! Though with its size it would be hard to lose track of it. Travel has been smooth, and fortunately the Leviathan seems to produce an unending supply of nutrition, so just like the celestial aquatic creatures that follow it, we’ll also be able to without worry!” The log starts shifting from a ship log to being research notes about the Leviathan.

Title: Log: Starlight (D14)
Branch: D14
Description: “It turns out rather than the Leviathan producing its own food, it is sustained off of starlight! Everything that is produced is simply a byproduct of the process! That explains why it is seemingly immortal. Its presence must help maintain the balance of ecosystems it passes through, letting everything that takes part in it thrive!” The logs start shifting from research notes to a personal journal.

Title: Log: Last Wish (D15)
Branch: D15
Description: “It’s been a few days since the Leviathan fell into the black hole. It will be a one way trip, but deliberating with the crew, they agreed to let me follow it in.” … “I found it rather quickly but it seems to be in bad condition. There isn’t enough light to sustain its massive size.” … “I think I hear crying.” … “I wish I could help the Leviathan, if only I had the means to warp it out of this place”. When you try to go to the next, the monitor displays “No new entries”. With that last wish being the final entry of the logs, you take your leave of the old ship and return to your own.

Title: Meet the Leviathan (D18)
Branch: D18
Description: Finally arriving at the once distant body, you land. To the mass that now appears to stretch out like an unending wall, you call out. Slowly revealing itself, you recognize the draconic eye that you saw in the vision during your youth. “You have come, thank you for answering my call.” echoes in your mind. With this you’re certain that the source of your call to act and the Leviathan that was mentioned during your journey are the same.

Title: Leviathan's Plea (D19)
Branch: D19
Description: “After falling into this place, I’ve been unable to soar, and have no means to replenish my strength. Being stuck here I can’t fulfill my duty. I hoped that my call would reach someone, someone who loved creatures, and that perhaps they could save me from this end.” Did you find how you could help the Leviathan?

Title: Hidden Ending: Balance (D26)
Branch: D26
Description: Recalling the last wish written in the old ship’s logs, you prepare to warp the Leviathan out of the black hole. The Leviathan disappears with a blink as you warp it out, and you quickly follow suit. As you spot the welcoming sight of your home planet, your attention is hooked by the Leviathan, as its scales glisten like the stars that it draws sustenance from as they are revitalized under the warm light of the sun. The celestial aquatic creatures flock to the Leviathan as it swims. The familiar sensation of a flash and voice enter your mind. “Thank you, thank you for your help! I can now resume my stewardship of life among the stars. As you have granted me, I hope that your duty is fulfilled!” As the joyous voice leaves your mind, you return home to recount your journey to your boss. You successfully found the root cause of the declining fish population, being the disappearance of the Leviathan, which brought balance to the environment. With this realization, the solution you decide upon is to take on a similar role of being in balance with the environment, so both the planet’s people and fish thrive.

Title: Decades Later: Balance (D27)
Branch: D27

You’ve finally returned home after travelling the galaxy and sharing your findings with others. You now know what the starry expanse before you contains, and how to live in harmony with it as well. As you lie down under the stars, a familiar creature swims through the space above.
 
Title: Final Lessons (D20)
Branch: D20
Description: During your journey across Mossara, Glaciera and the flight in the black hole, you did not find any information on how you could potentially help the Leviathan. With a slow close to the draconic eye, the Leviathan understands your thoughts. “My wish has gone unfulfilled, however I am grateful that my final moments are not spent alone. I hope that our meeting can help you at the least.” The voice goes silent, and you can feel a connection in your mind cut. While unable to help the Leviathan, your mission is not done. The solution to the food crisis rests before you.
Choice: display=[Reflect on your experiences]; next=D21

Title: Choose the Future (D21)
Branch: D21
Description: After looking through the memories of your journey again, two ideas spring to mind, inspired by your travels. One is that like on Mossara, you could take the bounty that is the Leviathan to your home. With its size, even if the fish population disappeared the people of your planet could stay fed. The other, inspired by the people of Glaciera, would be to take the Leviathan and have it serve the galaxy as a whole by breaking down its body to spread nutrition. Doing this would replenish the diminishing populations and revitalize the ecosystems that it passes through. Now you just have to choose which one to go with.
Choice: display=[Bring the Leviathan’s body home]; next=D22

Title: Ending: Harvest Home (D22)
Branch: D22
Description: Setting the coordinates for the orbit of your home planet, you warp yourself and the Leviathan’s body out of the black hole. Momentarily blinded by the sudden change of brightness, you reopen your eyes to see the Leviathan’s body orbiting the welcoming sight of your home planet. Bringing the good news to your boss, you tell them of your journey and about the new body that is orbiting the planet. “You’ve done a fantastic job! You’re the hero of our planet!” While the praise is nice, you do hold the small regret of not being able to help the Leviathan.
Choice: display=[Decades later]; next=D23

Title: Decades Later: Harvest (D23)
Branch: D23
Description: With the passing decades, the Leviathan has gotten smaller as it is harvested for food. The fish population slightly recovered as they were no longer necessary for your planet’s survival, though the population never did return to what it was before the decline. You’ve started to get travellers on a similar journey that you had gone through all those years ago. It leaves you with a nagging concern for the future.

Bringing the good news to your boss, you tell them of your journey and your plan for the future. With approval from your boss, you prepare to head out on a new ship to spread the Leviathan’s remains across the galaxy, though you do hold the small regret of not being able to help the Leviathan.
Choice: display=[Decades later]; next=D25

Title: Decades Later: Cycle (D25)
Branch: D25
Description: After spreading the Leviathan’s remains across the galaxy, the population of the celestial aquatic creatures reached new record highs, leading to bountiful years of food. However, now the populations have started to decline again, a similar trend reappearing. While the planet will be fine for a while, you foresee that someone may have to travel a similar path as you, though they may not be as fortunate in finding a solution.
