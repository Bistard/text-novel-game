Description: You wake up, a light cool breeze flowing through your hair, grass flowing in the wind, the quiet of night. Your nap in the field was refreshing. You gaze at the stars, wondering "What is out there? Will I ever see beyond this starry expanse?" You say that as you see a stream of celestial aquatic creatures swim across the night sky. You make out that they are a myriad of various common fish, cephalopods, even sharks just from a glance. Your interest peaks yet your sadness valleys. The thought of such beautiful creatures slowly dying out crosses your mind like a flash flood.

Description: All over the news there is data from scientists saying that there is a gradual decline in the fish supply. You make the decision that it will be you, you will be the one to end this upcoming crisis. You gaze to the sky once more in determination and just as you make the decision, a flash comes across your mind. “Help…. me…..” A draconic eye opens, strained and tired. “A vision?” Your own mouth utters without prior thought “Who was that and where did it come from?” You say as you look to the centre of the galaxy in the starry night above as if some strange force pulls you there. Confused, you still go with your goal to end this crisis but with the lingering thought that the vision is connected.
