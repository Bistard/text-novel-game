Description: You wake up, a light cool breeze flowing through your hair, grass flowing in the wind, the quiet of night. Your nap in the field was refreshing. You gaze at the stars, wondering "What is out there? Will I ever see beyond this starry expanse?" You say that as you see a stream of celestial aquatic creatures swim across the night sky. You make out that they are a myriad of various common fish, cephalopods, even sharks just from a glance. Your interest peaks yet your sadness valleys. The thought of such beautiful creatures slowly dying out crosses your mind like a flash flood.

You make the decision that it will be you, you will be the one to end this upcoming crisis. You gaze to the sky once more in determination and just as you make the decision, a flash comes across your mind. “Help…. me…..” A draconic eye opens, strained and tired. “A vision?” Your own mouth utters without prior thought “Who was that and where did it come from?” You say as you look to the centre of the galaxy in the starry night above as if some strange force pulls you there. Confused, you still go with your goal to end this crisis but with the lingering thought that the vision is connected.

The rich greenery is viewable from space, though dark patches of gray and brown seem to dot the land as well. As you descend upon the planet, you get a closer look of those darkened patches of Mossara, seeing abandoned factories, tainted waters and dying vegetation.

Pillars deteriorating from years of holding up inhabited rooms. Beyond the view, the forest greenery shone upon the village showing nature's habitat consuming the structures that once lay there. The place was frozen between hidden memories, mysteries, and nature. Passing through a bundle of vines reveals an entrance inside. Looking in, you see it, massive mosaics of oil spilled everywhere surrounding the place. The black liquid seeped into the soil, leaving only dying plants, brown and wilted.

Title: Mossara-18
Branch: B18
Description: For the first time, the statue lady parted her lips and spoke with weight. “Humans destroyed this world. They polluted the land and hoarded its wealth. They took the gift of surplus agriculture and used it to create a hierarchy among themselves. It left me, Gaia, in a weakened state unable to help the lives that they forsook. It resulted in bountiful excess for them, but it wasn’t enough. They continued to fight each other for more, leaving the environment and others to die. Eventually, when there was nothing left for them to take, they left this planet. With them gone, the enduring pieces of life were able to regrow, and I was once again able to be a steward for this land. However, I still cannot fix all the problems they created.”

Title: Mossara-19
Branch: B19
Description: The two pressing problems are a mechanical beast that has reawoken and is pillaging the land, spreading the oil as it does so. The other is a mountain of debris that is damming the river, causing the tainted water to stagnate and rot the land.
