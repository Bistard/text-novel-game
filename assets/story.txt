::prologue
title: The Subtle Pulse
text:
The dawn sirens never howl anymore. Instead, a soft rhythm rises from the stonework beneath Aravon, syncing with your heartbeat until it feels like the city itself is whispering your name.

Council summons blink on your wrist-slate, demanding a formal briefing. Yet the western rim lights with wild static, promising answers no agenda will offer.
/text
choices:
- Attend the council briefing -> dawn_briefing | adjust=insight:+1 | log=You answered the council's call despite the pull of the pulse.
- Slip away to scout the western rim -> silent_watch | adjust=resolve:+1 | log=You trusted your instincts and slipped into the ruins alone.
/choices

::dawn_briefing
title: Briefing Hall
text:
The council chamber smells of old ozone and newer anxiety. Holo-sheets hang over the dais, flickering with incomplete telemetry. Matriarch Solis regards you with tired eyes that plead for certainty.

"We need a reading, Aryn. Take this encoded map. It should overlay the fault-lines," she says, sliding a crystalline shard toward you.
/text
choices:
- Accept the encoded map and pledge a swift report -> council_map | item=add:Encoded Map | log=The council entrusted you with their only map overlay.
- Press for additional operatives to join you -> intel_hall | adjust=influence:-1 | log=You challenged the council's plan and demanded support.
/choices

::silent_watch
title: Western Rim
text:
You follow the pulse across shattered plazas to the rim towers that once shielded Aravon. Static plays across the horizon like northern lights, bathing abandoned consoles in ghostly azure.

Every instinct says whatever wakes is listening. Alone, you can move without the weight of the council's expectations.
/text
choices:
- Sync your slate to the rim beacons -> rim_path | adjust=insight:+1 | log=You synced the rim beacons to triangulate the underground signal.
- Slip into the monitoring station's dark interior -> monitoring_station | adjust=resolve:+1 | log=You braved the silent station to chase the resonance within.
/choices

::council_map
title: Map Repository
text:
The shard hums in your hand, projecting translucent corridors spiraling beneath the city. Each path is annotated with risks and the names of scouts who never returned.

A technician offers you a spool of old field notes—scribbled warnings that never made it to the archives.
/text
choices:
- Study the field notes before departing -> archives | adjust=insight:+1 | log=You took time to study prior failures.
- Ignore the warnings and head straight to the rim -> rim_path | adjust=resolve:+1 | log=You trusted your instincts over annotated cautions.

::intel_hall
title: Hall of Operatives
text:
Your request echoes through the hall. Only the rookies respond, their faces pale behind mirrored visors. They lack the resonance training that keeps you grounded when the whispers rise.

One volunteer, Kessa, offers a contraband bypass key, grinning like this is some midnight adventure.

::outpost_inside
title: Inner Outpost
text:
The hidden outpost hums awake when your beacon pings its gate. Holo-glyphs describe an experimental conduit sealed after the "Songfall Incident". Kessa, if she's with you, looks around in awe.

title: Final Convergence Lock
text:
Three concentric rings orbit a luminous core. Symbols float between them, forming equations you feel rather than see. The intelligence waits, curious whether you can open the final seal.
/text
choices:
