Description: You wake up, a light cool breeze flowing through your hair, grass flowing in the wind, the quiet of night. Your nap in the field was refreshing. You gaze at the stars, wondering "What is out there? Will I ever see beyond this starry expanse?" You say that as you see a stream of celestial aquatic creatures swim across the night sky. You make out that they are a myriad of various common fish, cephalopods, even sharks just from a glance. Your interest peaks yet your sadness valleys. The thought of such beautiful creatures slowly dying out crosses your mind like a flash flood.

You make the decision that it will be you, you will be the one to end this upcoming crisis. You gaze to the sky once more in determination and just as you make the decision, a flash comes across your mind. “Help…. me…..” A draconic eye opens, strained and tired. “A vision?” Your own mouth utters without prior thought “Who was that and where did it come from?” You say as you look to the centre of the galaxy in the starry night above as if some strange force pulls you there. Confused, you still go with your goal to end this crisis but with the lingering thought that the vision is connected.

The rich greenery is viewable from space, though dark patches of gray and brown seem to dot the land as well. As you descend upon the planet, you get a closer look of those darkened patches of Mossara, seeing abandoned factories, tainted waters and dying vegetation.

Strolling deeper into the forest, she leaves a carpet of bright red tiger lilies trailing behind her.

Title: Mossara-10
Branch: B10
Description: You make your way to the overgrown building. Shrubs grow in between wooden floor boards, vines hanging off stone walls. Abandoned tools scattered along the dirt road. Pillars deteriorating from years of holding up inhabited rooms. Beyond the view, the forest greenery shone upon the village showing nature's habitat consuming the structures that once lay there. The place was frozen between hidden memories, mysteries, and nature. Passing through a bundle of vines reveals an entrance inside. Looking in, you see it, massive mosaics of oil spilled everywhere surrounding the place. The black liquid seeped into the soil, leaving only dying plants, brown and wilted.

Choice: display=[Follow her along the path]; next=B17

Title: Mossara-17
Branch: B17
Description: Following her lead, you enter a clearing with a waterfall that was once full of life but now stood in ruin. The water that was once clear and streaming with life, ran completely ruined and dark, carrying the weight and decay of oil beneath the lost area. The earth was scarred with plants wilted, the bodies of once lively creatures now floated dead lifeless through the stream. The air was full of mourning as if the land lost all life to breath.
Choice: display=[Ask her what happened]; next=B18

Title: Mossara-18
Branch: B18
Description: For the first time, the statue lady parted her lips and spoke with weight. “Humans destroyed this world. They polluted the land and hoarded its wealth. They took the gift of surplus agriculture and used it to create a hierarchy among themselves. It left me, Gaia, in a weakened state unable to help the lives that they forsook. It resulted in bountiful excess for them, but it wasn’t enough. They continued to fight each other for more, leaving the environment and others to die. Eventually, when there was nothing left for them to take, they left this planet. With them gone, the enduring pieces of life were able to regrow, and I was once again able to be a steward for this land. However, I still cannot fix all the problems they created.”
Choice: display=[Inquire about the problems]; next=B19

Title: Mossara-19
Branch: B19
Description: The two pressing problems are a mechanical beast that has reawoken and is pillaging the land, spreading the oil as it does so. The other is a mountain of debris that is damming the river, causing the tainted water to stagnate and rot the land. Together these problems have created a stalemate, where we can’t make progress on either issue without the other interfering. If one is dealt with, I can remedy the other over time.

Something else that may help would be to search for the great Leviathan. It’s a massive creature that could be seen swimming around the planet. It hasn’t been sighted for a long time, even when the humans of this planet were still around. Perhaps they left in hunt of it”.

Description: As you descend through the clouds of Glaciera, a translucent shimmer stretches across the planet’s surface—like an ocean frozen mid-wave. The sun peeks from the horizon, refracting light across the glassy crust. You're struck with awe—until something thuds against your windshield. It's a fish—no, something stranger. Covered in white fur, it twirls through the air like a snowflake, then vanishes into the gleaming light. The moment lingers.

Title: Glaciera-02
Branch: C2
Description: As you prepare for landing, you notice dots on the ice field—small at first, then growing larger, morphing into lines, then shapes. They're not cracks. They're bicycles—massive ones—riding straight toward you. In an instant, iron chains whip through the air and latch onto your ship’s frame. The vessels encircle you like a pack of wolves. From each bike, figures in fur-lined armor leap onto the chains and approach your ship with synchronized steps.

You're fishing for Glaciera now.” Several members climb aboard your ship. “Don’t get clever. We’ll be watching.” As you launch toward the polar sea, the assigned crew brief you on the planet’s collectivist ideals and their fragile food systems. You begin to understand what balance here truly means.

Do something that helps everyone.” She nods toward a tattered logbook. “There were rumors once… of a celestial being. Massive. Sustaining entire ecosystems. Maybe the Leviathan? Could be myth.” As she speaks, the ship slows. You’ve reached the icy trench—time to fish.

Then work like we do.” You're sent to labor within one of the igloo settlements nearby. Among the domes, two structures catch your attention: one with wooden interiors and scattered papers, the other larger, smoke curling from a chimney overhead.

Curious about how we survive?” They begin to explain the planet’s collectivist system—resources pooled, no leaders, all shared. A worn book mentions something massive that once swam through the stars—something called the Leviathan.

Title: Glaciera-C12
Branch: C12
Description: Inside the larger igloo, several people are gathered around a central cooking pit. One of them gestures for you to sit. Over shared rations, they speak of Glaciera’s values: unity over ego, contribution over ambition. “If only we had the Leviathan,” someone says. “That thing could sustain a whole continent.” The name lingers like a ghost of a solution.
